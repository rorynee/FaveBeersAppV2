# Fave Beers App V2

##About
Create a simple app that hooks into the beers api. This app should be similar to the Tinder app in its features.

Tinder For Beer Drinkers

##Screen Shots

Screen Chots can be found in the display images folder  

##Functionality

The app should display a beer from the beers api. The user should be able to swipe left or right to "like" or "dislike" the beers. Alternatively the user has the option to use buttons to achieve the same result. After the user has liked 10 beers, they should be shown a list of the beers they have just liked. The presentation of this list can be done via a simple dialog view, or whatever approach you desire to use.

 
###Tasks in order of preference 

1. Implement the Retrofit library for network calls

2. Build a simple skeleton UI

3. Use Picasso to load and display images.

4. Implement a richer UI

5. Implement the swipe left or right gestures


##What’s New?

The main difference between v1 and v2 is task 5 has been implemented. In addition to this some error handling (Internet connection) and a richer UI including icons were added.
